It was never clear what I wanted to do. I knew I liked drawing and art. I was always busy drawing in class when I should have been paying attention. It was just more fun to draw then listen to my teacher talk about math. I disliked math because I did not understand it, I preferred english class and sometimes history class. It wasn’t until later on in high school when I started to appreciate math a little more. I started to like the challenge of solving an equation.

I replaced the ram on my desktop computer and I felt like I conquered the world. I had to figure how to remove the lid, find the ram drive and put in the new one. I had experience using a computer because I would play games with my friends, but I had never tried anything like that before. I think I was around 15 years old and I personally had achieved something amazing because I had solved something. This little experience was actually how I decided to pursue a career in technology.

My first two years in college really taught me how clueless I was. C++ was my first programming language and to say I had trouble with it would be mitigating the experience. I could not wrap my head around these new concepts. It took me forever to learn the loops, and by the time I finally got it I was already 3 chapters behind. My failure at farmingdale taught me humility but It did not stop me from pursuing programming. I transferred over to community college because farmingdale did not have the web development track I wanted to get into.

I bought books for web development, and I tried learning on my own before college started. I really enjoyed it. I loved seeing those first lines of text appear on the browser. I was changing the background color of the webpage and magic was happening! My skills progressed and while I continued to enjoy making webpages, I also started to get interested in making games. It was then that I wanted the ability to create. technology is the future with programming at its core. I want to learn the concepts, so I can transfer those skills to other fields such as games, or desktop applications, virtual reality or AI. I know It’s going to take time, I’ll put in the work now so I can enjoy the reward later.
