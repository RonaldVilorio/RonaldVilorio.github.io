My Sinatra portfolio project went a lot faster and smoother than my cli data gem project. Structuring the project went a lot easier, as I took it step by step each do setting up and doing all the needed configurations. I started by getting all the files into my IDE so making sure that I had all necessary files in place. I actually wrote all my steps down in a text file so i clearly knew what to focus on next. I did my project on Goals and Subgoals belonging to a user.

Deciding on the relationships of the models took me some time because I wanted to make sure It was making sense, and I didn’t want to come back and mess with that when I would be working on my routes. I made it so a goal belongs to a user, and a user has many goals.A user can have many subgoals through goals and a goal can have many subgoals through the join table that I made to connect goal and subgoals. I reciprocated the relationship with subgoals through the join table to have all relationships connected. Having all of that done was already a great accomplishment and I could move on to the next phase.

I wasn’t entirely sure on my routes, so I just added CRUD routes for the goals and subgoals, and I would adjust later on If i wanted or needed to change any of the routes. It took me a few days to get all my routes down and have everything working how I wanted it to work. Sometimes it helps a tremendous amount to just take a break for half an hour. Breaks worked wonders for me as I would be stuck on something and come back an 1 hour later to just fix the problem in under 10 minutes. 

The final phase would be styling, and I learned I’m not the expert of html and css that I thought I was. I took some styling off another side project and incorporated the h2 headings into my goal lister. Anything I wasn’t too sure about I always had my friend Google to help me out with, and while the design is not the most beautiful, my personal main focus was more on the functionality of the project.

I’m glad I was able to finish and deliver a project that I myself can see using in the future. So I had that intention from the beginning. It really helps to motivate you to work on the project when you actually want to create something that you yourself will use in the future. I’ll see to any refactoring that I need to do and with that I’m off to learning Rails!
