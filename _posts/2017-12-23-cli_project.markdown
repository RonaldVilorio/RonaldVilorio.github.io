I decided on doing a library search gem for my cli project. I ended up using the the World Cat library search API and slowly started to take the step by step process to completing the project. It took a bit longer than expected but working on it and asking for help when I needed it really added up to finally completing it.

I'll be honest here, I was intimidated with the project. I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but I also knew I was very capable of finishing. The trick to it is taking a piece at a time, kind of like if you had a goal of eating a whole pizza. If you looked at the whole pizza then a bit of discouragement would build up, but If you ended up taking a slice at a time, with rest periods then the pizza would be finished and your goal would be accomplished. My problem for this project was that I kept looking at the whole pizza, I would take half a slice but would look back at the box and get discouraged. I would work and get some parts of the project complete but then get stuck and discouraged, it started to be feel overwhelming.

I attended a CLI study group hosted by Corinna that went over all of the setup with the API. The lecture helped a tremendous amount and I was able to make progress again. I had a problem with connecting the API to my api class since I didn't have a wskey and I didn' know I had to delete the curly braces surrounding the wskey. Kevin helped me out with that and navigating through the documentation of the api to change the parameters. I greatly appreciate his help and It would have taken me way longer to finish without his assistance.

I then looked at the example projects for guidance, and finishing my project went by quickly after that. Getting the data from the API was by far the biggest challenge, and what took me the longest to do. It feels great after finishing though, and every goal completed reminds me that anything is possible and can be achieved if you really want it or need it. I look forward to the rest of the challenges.
